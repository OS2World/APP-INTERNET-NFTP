    [ The following text is in the "iso-8859-1" character set. ]

Here are the changes needed for OS/2 NLS/MNU conversion to Linux
NLS/MNU:

1) Small o with dots: 0x94 hex (148 dec) to 0xF6 hex (246 dec)
2) Small a with dots: 0x84 hex (132 dec) to 0xE4 hex (228 dec)
3) Small a with ring: 0x86 hex (134 dec) to 0xE5 hex (229 dec)
4) Capital O with dots: 0x99 hex (153 dec) to 0xD6 hex (214 dec)
5) Capital A with dots: 0x8E hex (142 dec) to 0xC4 hex (196 dec)
6) Capital A with ring: 0x8F hex (143 dec) to 0xC5 hex (197 dec)

These are the three common scandinavian letters in use here in Finland.
3 and 6 are quite rare nowadays and I don't think they aren't even used
in NLS/MNU right now. I suspect these conversions are needed for
Swedish, Norwegian and Danish too but they might also need some extra
conversion for their local characters (especially Norwegian has some
strange characters).
