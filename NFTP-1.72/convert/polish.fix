I think the solution no. 2 would be the best. Other languages could also have
some problems with graphical symbols, not necessarily under Win32.

I have found that the M_FILL2 symbol is also changed during the ISO-8859-2 => Cp 852
translation phase. Then I decide to write a simple perl script, that
excludes lines with M_graphic symbols that begins with ^\s+{.
I enclose this small perl file to this letter.
